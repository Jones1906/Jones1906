<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Software Development Projects:</h2>

- <b>Student Registration System</b>
  - [Student Registration System in C](https://github.com/Jones1906/Student-Reg.-System)
  - This project is a C program that simulates a student registration system. It allows students to register for courses, drop courses, and view their registration status.

- <b>Student Grades Analysis</b>
  - [Student Grades Analysis in C](https://github.com/Jones1906/Student-Grades-Analysis)
  - This project is a C program that reads student data from a file, calculates the average and median grades, and sorts the students by their student IDs. It also determines the letter grade for each student.

- <b>Car Lot Management System</b>
  - [Car Lot Management System in Java](https://github.com/Jones1906/Car-Lot-Management-System)
  - Welcome to JT's Used Car Lot Management System! This project is a simple yet efficient car lot management system designed to help manage the inventory of cars in a used car lot. It includes functionalities to add, remove, and search for cars.

- <b>Object Oriented Programming Encryption Project</b>
  - [Practicing OOP in Java](https://github.com/Jones1906/Ciphers)
  - Implemented encryption algorithms (Caesar and Vigen√®re ciphers) which improved my ability to understand and implement complex algorithms. This project developed my error handling and the use of OOP principles.

- <b>Banner Designing Project</b>
  - [Practicing Linux Shell in Ubuntu Vmware](https://github.com/Jones1906/Banner)
  - Crafted a script that calculates the width of the terminal, centers text within a border, and handles various input options demanding logical thinking and algorithmic design.

- <b>Prime Number Generator</b>
  - [Practicing Web programming using HTML](https://github.com/Jones1906/PrimeNumberGen)
  - This program generates prime numbers between the respective upper and lower range.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Currently Working On:</h2>

- <b>Academic Assignment in Compilers</b>
  - [C- Repository (Private)](https://github.com/Jones1906/C-)
  - Developing a compiler called RANDI is designed as a subset of the R language, with a focus on simplifying statistical computing, data analysis, and visualization tasks. It offers a range of keywords, datatypes, and control structures tailored for these purposes. Despite being slower compared to compiled languages like C, RANDI provides extensive libraries and packages optimized for statistical analysis. Its goal is to facilitate easy manipulation of SQL databases with minimal effort, making it particularly useful for data-centric applications. The language implementation strategy revolves around parsing and translating RANDI code into ANSI C, leveraging existing C datatypes and functionalities. It employs familiar syntax elements such as {} for defining blocks of code within loops and conditionals, akin to C. Overall, RANDI aims to provide a user-friendly interface for statisticians and data analysts, streamlining their workflow in handling complex datasets.
